# Entity-Level-Sentiment-Analysis
I used SpaCy and TextBlob to find entities , descriptions and sentiment_scores respectively.

Steps I followed :

a) Read .json file into dataframe
      
b) Data cleaning
      
c) Find entities (aspect) using SpaCy
      
d) Find description (adverb + adjective) using SpaCy 
	
e) Find most frequent entities
	
f) Find the sentiment score of description using TextBlob
