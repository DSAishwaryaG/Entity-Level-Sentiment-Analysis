# Entity-Level-Sentiment-Analysis
I used SpaCy and TextBlob to find entities , descriptions and sentiment_scores respectively.

Steps I followed :

Read .json file into dataframe
      
Data cleaning
      
Find entities (aspect) using SpaCy
      
Find description (adverb + adjective) using SpaCy 
	
Find most frequent entities
	
Find the sentiment score of description using TextBlob

Label the sentiment score
